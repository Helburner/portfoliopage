<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>I have a background in all that's related to digital marketing & comms, from website content management, through online ad campaigns, to social media and community management.</p>
<p>I love the 'digital revolution' we're living everyday and I'm very curious about how all the technological developments that are taking place will shape our lives, our cultures and societies in the not-so-distant future.</p>

<h1>Where I'm from</h1>
<p>I'm from Craiova, in the south of Romania, but I've been living in the capital, Bucharest, for the past 10 years.</p>

<h1>More about me</h1>
<h2>Hobbies, interests</h2>
<p>Sci-fi & fantasy literature, arthouse films, gaming (started with the PC, went through both Xbox360 and PS3, finally went back to the PC!), hiking in the mountains, Irish dancing, martial arts, photography.</p>
<h2>Dream job</h2>
<p>I would have loved to be a travel photographer and writer, roaming the globe, immersing myself in all sorts of places, histories and cultures and then showing them & telling their stories to people the world over.</p>
<h2>What music have I been listening to lately?</h2>
<p>Well, after recently binge-watching Mozart in the Jungle, I've rediscovered classical music (again!), so I've been revisiting a lot of Beethoven, Chopin and the like. Oh, and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/antirecords/sets/dead-mans-bones-dead-mans-bones" target="blank">Dead Man's Bones</a>.</p>
